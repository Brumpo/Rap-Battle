# ERIC ANDRE SNAKE
using the phaser html 5 gaming framework, I hope to make an Eric Andre snake game that is adult swim themed. It will contain both a landing page that has various Eric Andre Show gifs and images as well as a game page that displays the actual snake game that has fun eric andre themes and a couple of tweeks to the orginal snake game including fun images and out-of-window effects.
